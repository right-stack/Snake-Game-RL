# Implementation of Snake game 
Here we implemented the snake game using Deep Q learning model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf). We started by building the environment which includes snake, food,playground or screen and set some policies of the game. Some of those policies are like to stop a game if the snake collides with the border of the screen or hit itself. Our model as an agent allowed to start playing randomly by interacting with the environment so that after some games it can manage to play well. The more games the more our agent plays well.

# Install pygame

Pip install pygame

# Run code

cd Snake-RL-AMMI

python dqn-agent.py


# Create the screen


# Moving the snake



# Game over



# Adding snake Food


# State


# Action


# Display results
